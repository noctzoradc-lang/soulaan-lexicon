## Overview

The **Soulaan Lexicon of Continuity** is a foundational, continuity-based definitional reference documenting the ethnocultural identity of a people formed and sustained on American soil through multigenerational land-embedded continuity, cultural development, and intergenerational transmission.

This Lexicon is **definitional, not advocative**.  
It does not assert political sovereignty, territorial jurisdiction, citizenship authority, or legal tribal status. Its purpose is to stabilize meaning for educational, administrative, scholarly, and institutional use by distinguishing **peoplehood** from race, nationality, ancestry-only frameworks, and external classification systems.

Definitions are declarative, scoped, and structured for long-term citation and institutional clarity.

---

## Governance & Stewardship

- **Governing Authority:** Freedmen Reparations Fund Trust (FRFT)  
- **Steward:** Dwayne Coleman  
- **Status:** Provisional Edition (Issued for Review and Certification)

Stewardship refers to responsibility for definitional integrity, land-embedded kinship coherence, and disciplined versioning.  
It does not constitute ownership of identity or authority over self-identification outside institutional contexts.

---

## Structure

The Lexicon is organized into six sections:

- **Section A:** Foundational Principles & Peoplehood Definitions  
- **Section B:** Interpretive, Methodological & Governance Terms  
- **Section C:** Cultural, Linguistic & Spiritual Systems  
- **Section D:** Identity, Classification & Institutional Application  
- **Section E:** Diaspora, Boundary & Demarcation Terms  
- **Section F:** Comparative Ethnic & Ethno-National Terms  

Each term appears **once** as a canonical definition.  
Subentries, notes, and cross-references are used to preserve clarity without duplication.
